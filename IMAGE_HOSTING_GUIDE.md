## Current Google Drive Issues

### Problem:
- Slow loading
- Requires proper sharing permissions
- Thumbnail API not reliable
- Can be blocked in some regions

### Your Current URLs:
```
https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=FILE_ID&sz=w1000
```

### Need to Share Properly:
1. Right-click file in Google Drive
2. Click "Share"
3. Change to "Anyone with the link can view"
4. Make sure it's PUBLIC

---

## Quick Fix for Current Images

If you want to keep Google Drive temporarily, make sure:

1. **All images are set to PUBLIC** (Anyone with link can view)
2. **Use this URL format**:
   ```
   https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=FILE_ID
   ```

But for best results, use ImgBB or host locally! ðŸš€
